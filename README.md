This is the source project for the linux version of FloppyMaintenance.  
It is currently being updated in the Windows version and from time to 
time, I apply these changes to the linux version 

Not all features are currently available. This version does not support the  
built in editor like the Windows version does. That is because the Windows  
version uses the ActiPro Syntac editor that requires a license to develop 
with.
  
The export files for all diskette formats works. The only import that 
works reliably is the import of FLEX files. The FLEX Randon file is not 
supported for import.  <br/>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting the other diskette format imports to work <br/>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a built in editor that does not require ActiPro
