### This is the source project for the linux version of FloppyMaintenance.

  Not all features are current available. This version does not support the 
  built in editor like the Windows version does. That is because the Windows
  version uses the ActiPro Syntac editor that requires a license to develop 
  with.
  
  The export files for all diskette formats works. The only import that 
  works reliably is the import of FLEX files. The FLEX Randon file is not 
  supported for import.
